Another Guide Remover Plugin for Sketch
=============

I haven't seen any Sketch plugin that deletes all guides used in the document. So here it is. The idea of that plugin was born in the #sketch channel of [Creative Russia](http://creativerussia.co) community.

## Usage
The default command bind to remove all guides on all pages and artboards is:
* **Control + Shift + Option + R**

## Installation

### via Sketch

Open **Sketch**, on menu **Plugin > Reveal Plugins Folder**.
Download the repo as ZIP and extract to above directory.

### via Git (using Command-line)

```
$ cd ~/Library/Application Support/com.bohemiancoding.sketch3/Plugins

$ git clone https://github.com/bbsody/sketch-guides-remover
```
